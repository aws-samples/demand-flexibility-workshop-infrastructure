# demand-flexibility-workshop-infra

## Getting started

This repo is to support the workshop [Renewable Energy Assets in the Smart Home:(Managing Demand Flexibility)](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/93d77bd0-073e-445f-82f8-db877beb9d7a)


In this workshop, you will learn how to manage demand flexibility for residential properties equipped with interconnected renewable energy assets using a digital twin, which includes an electric vehicle and solar panels. Develop strategies for efficiently managing a surge in energy production by utilizing renewable energy resources to their fullest extent while ensuring grid stability and reducing the need for grid-supplied energy. Learn how to integrate AWS services with a digital twin, explore strategies for optimizing renewable energy utilization, and understand the demand-side response in the context of variable renewable energy generation. You must bring your laptop to participate.
